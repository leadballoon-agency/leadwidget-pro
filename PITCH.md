# YC Construction Garden Assessment Widget
## Partnership Proposal for Cam

---

## Executive Summary

I've built a **custom, mobile-first assessment tool** specifically designed for YC Construction's new build garden market. This widget transforms your website into a lead-generation machine by creating the **high-quality engagement signals** Meta's AI craves.

**Result:** Higher quality leads, lower cost per lead, and instant WhatsApp conversations with pre-qualified prospects.

---

## The Problem (What We Discussed)

You're experiencing:
- ❌ Drop in qualified leads from Meta ads
- ❌ Rise in "junk leads" (tire-kickers)
- ❌ Meta AI rejecting weak conversion signals
- ❌ Need for consolidated campaigns with **creative diversity**

**Root Cause:** Meta's new Andromeda AI rewards **engagement quality**, not just form fills.

---

## The Solution: Garden Assessment Widget

A 60-second interactive tool that:

### 1. **Creates Premium Engagement Signals**
- 2-5 minutes on-site (vs. 30 seconds for a form)
- 8 interaction points (clicks, selections, inputs)
- Meta AI learns: "This audience is **genuinely interested**"

### 2. **Self-Qualifies Leads**
- Budget range question filters out low-intent
- Timeline question identifies urgency
- Problem selection reveals true needs
- **No more junk leads**

### 3. **Captures Leads via WhatsApp**
- Final CTA: "Send us a photo via WhatsApp"
- Pre-filled message with their assessment data
- **Instant conversation starter**
- You get: Phone number + context + photo in one message

### 4. **Perfectly Branded for YC Construction**
- Matches your website design exactly
- Award-winning positioning (Landscaper of Year 2024)
- Premium but approachable tone
- Mobile-first (98% of users)

## How It Works

### User Journey:

**Step 1: Hook** (Hero Screen)
> "Is Your New Build Garden Costing You £20k?"
>
> → Clicks "Start Assessment"

**Step 2: Questions** (60 seconds)
1. How long ago did you move in?
2. What did the builder leave you with?
3. What's your biggest problem? (multi-select)
4. What would transform your home?
5. Garden size estimate?
6. When are you looking to start?
7. What's your budget range? ← **Qualification**
8. Your postcode? (optional)

**Step 3: Results** (Instant)
- **Score:** 6.5/10 - "Quick Wins Available"
- **Issues Detected:** Drainage Risk (High), Value Gap (£30k-£52k)
- **Recommended Package:** Premium Enhancement (£20k-£35k)
- **Social Proof:** Awards, experience, local projects

**Step 4: WhatsApp CTA**
> "📸 Send us a photo via WhatsApp"
>
> Opens WhatsApp with pre-filled message:
> ```
> Hi! I just completed the garden assessment.
>
> My Score: 6.5/10
> Issues: Poor drainage, Lack of privacy
> Budget: £20k-£35k
> Timeline: ASAP (next 3 months)
>
> Here's a photo of my garden:
> ```

## Why This Works for Meta Ads

### Old Funnel (Current):
```
Ad → Landing Page → Form Fill (30 seconds) → Low signal
```

### New Funnel (With Widget):
```
Ad → Widget → 2-5 min engagement → WhatsApp → HIGH signal
```

**Meta AI learns:**
- These users spend 5+ minutes engaging
- They complete multi-step flows
- They take action (WhatsApp click)
- They're **serious buyers**

**Result:** Meta shows your ads to more people like this.
